# Parts of the flow

## XMLA Server
Any server supporting XMLA protocol should work. Main target is eMondrian.

## XMLA Datasource
Datasource is responsible for connecting to XMLA server. 

It works the next way:
1. In the constructor method `SOAPClient` is created. XMLAApi will be initialized and new session will be created.
```js
  constructor(
    id,
    url = "https://emondrian.ssemenkoff.dev/emondrian/xmla",
    caption,
  ) {
    this.id = id;
    this.url = url;
    this.caption = caption;
    this.cube = null;

    const initApi = async () => {
      this.client = await createClientAsync("def/xmla.wsdl");
      this.client.setEndpoint(url);

      this.api = new XMLAApi(this.client, url);
      await this.api.startSession();
    };

    initApi();
  }
```

2. `setCatalog` method should be called to store catalog
3. `setCube` method should be called to store cube
4. When `catalog` and `cube` are set `openCube` method should be called. This will create metadataStore and retrieve information from XMLA server.

MetaData can be retrieved via methods from `XMLADatasource` class:
    - `getHierarchies`
    - `getMeasures`
    - `getProperties`
    - `getLevels`
    - `getMember`

## XMLA Store

Responsible for creating MDX request from it's settings.

Contains next settings:
- rows
- columns
- measures
- rowsDrilldownMembers
- rowsExpandedMembers
- columnsDrilldownMembers
- columnsExpandedMembers

Also handles the logic of adding and removing expands/drilldowns with metadata from datasource.

Exposes `getData` method that will retrive the data from XMLA datasource after generating MDX based on current settings.

Communication with components utilizing the store is going throught event bus.
Default events are:
- `EXPAND:${this.id}`
- `COLLAPSE:${this.id}`
- `DRILLDOWN:${this.id}`
- `DRILLUP:${this.id}`

Example of default event:
```js
this.eventBus.on(`EXPAND:${this.id}`, ({ value, area }) => {
  if (area === "rows") {
    this.expandOnRows(value);
  } else if (area === "columns") {
    this.expandOnColumns(value);
  }
  this.eventBus.emit(`UPDATE:${this.id}`);
});
```

When some setting is updated emits event to force dependant components to refresh the data:
```js
setOptions({ caption, column, row, measure }) {
  this.caption = caption || this.caption;
  this.row = row || this.row;
  this.column = column || this.column;
  this.measure = measure || this.measure;

  this.eventBus.emit(`UPDATE:${this.id}`);
}
```

## Pivot Table Widgets

Stores visual settings and is responsible for visual event like resize. Parses MDX response to the format that it can utilize.

Reacts for events from store:
```js

watch(storeId, (newVal, oldVal) => {
  EventBus.off(`UPDATE:${oldVal}`, updateFn);
  EventBus.on(`UPDATE:${storeId.value}`, updateFn);

  getData();
});
```

## MDX Generator

Generates MDX request based on provided properties

Usage:
```js
const mdxRequest = await getMdxRequest(
  cubename: string,
  rowsDrilldownMembers: any,
  columnsDrilldownMembers: any,
  rowsExpandedMembers: any,
  columnsExpandedMembers: any,
  rows: any[],
  columns: any[],
  measures: any[],
  pivotTableSettings: any,
  properties: any[],
  filters: any[],
  levels: any[],
);
```
